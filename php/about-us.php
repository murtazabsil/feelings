<h1>Feelings Work methodology</h1>
<br>
<span class="subheading" style="color: #00B5EE; font-size: 20px;"><i
	class="fa fa-mail-forward"></i><b> Scoping</b> </span>
<p>In this initial interactive stage, project requirements and
objectives are gathered developed, and refined. We work together to
gather target objectives, create an initial SOW (Scope Of Work) analysis
and concluding on an initial Artistic Proposal based on your taste,
style and the budget allocated. This Artistic Proposal is woven into a
story as per the theme. The preparation for this requires a team effort
between the key decision makers and our designers. We need approximately
2-3hrs of meeting/phone discussion with your team and approximately 7
working days later for a personal presentation with the final decision
makers. Once a basic idea has been agreed we get on to second stage.
However we need to sign a non-disclosure-agreement before that.</p>
<span class="subheading" style="color: #00B5EE; font-size: 20px;"><i
	class="fa fa-mail-forward"></i><b> Design </b> </span>
<p>During this phase, emphasis is placed upon the "manufacturing" design
process to establish blueprints for necessary locations, and drawings
for presentation. Appropriate reviews are calibrated against meeting
objectives in order to keep the design phase on target. Once an
agreement is reached the process of development is initiated.</p>
<span class="subheading" style="color: #00B5EE; font-size: 20px;"><i
	class="fa fa-mail-forward"></i><b> Development </b> </span>
<p>It is during this phase that the actual materialization of all items
happen. For instance; venue booking, music arrangement, transportation
arranged, staging constructed, menus finalized, entertainment booked,
agendas created, vendors booked etc.</p>
<span class="subheading" style="color: #00B5EE; font-size: 20px;"><i
	class="fa fa-mail-forward"></i><b> Implementation</b> </span>
<p>The Event General Manager and the Events Management &amp; Production
Team, are on-site to bring all elements together for a successful event.
Load-in, set-up, rehearsals, and adjustments are made to completely
satisfy your requirements. This is where our experience and attention to
detail come together to deliver a flawless project.</p>
<span class="subheading" style="color: #00B5EE; font-size: 20px;"><i
	class="fa fa-mail-forward"></i><b> Evaluation</b> </span>
<p>â€¢ At this phase, your event is analyzed comparing audience reaction
against the stated objectives of your event. The evaluation, along with
a complete financial statement, is then packaged for management use.
This information is invaluable to our clients for measuring the impact
of their event\'s objectives while learning about marketing and
opportunities for the future.</p>
